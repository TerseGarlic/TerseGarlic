## Hi there 👋

I am TerseGarlic, a Senior Computer Science student!
Current on-going project I have are listed below:

Call of Duty NACE Pick and Ban Builder - https://github.com/TerseGarlic/NACE-Match-Build.git

This program I created because I am the captain of the ODU JV Call of Duty team, as well as a Varsity substitute player, and the NACE organization does not have an interactable Pick and Ban program in place.
So I created my own. It is in C#, and is being updated before the seasons start.
